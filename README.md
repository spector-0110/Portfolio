## What is This?

This is a **Next.js** project powered by [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).  
Why? Because reinventing the wheel is for philosophers, not developers.

My portfolio lives proudly at **[vatsa.works](https://vatsa.works)** and only there.

## ‚ùå How to Not Run This

For educational masochists who want to see how it *would* run (but really shouldn't):

```bash
npm run dev     # or yarn dev
# or pnpm dev
# or bun dev (if you're extra hipster)
